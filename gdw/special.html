<h1>Special Characters</h1>
Since &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have special meaning in HTML, you can't use these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called <q>special characters</q> to represent them. For instance, to have a less then sign appear in you document, you need to us <code>&amp;lt;</code> to represent it.
